These projects utilise **[pyqtgraph](https://www.pyqtgraph.org/)** a pure-python graphics and GUI library built on PyQt / PySide and numpy.

I have created several pyqtgraph dashboards for research projects which allow for data to be opened and inspected for rapid troubleshooting and identifying trends. These include presenting simple line and scatter plots for individual sources of a large database, 3D scatter plots coloured by properties, and interactive controls of filters or paramters.

The primary advantage of pyqtgraph is its speed. Studying a large sample size either requires the slow production of matplotlib figures (which can also require large disk space to save high quality images). Pyqtgraph generates figures quickly and also retains interactivtiy allowing further exploration of the data without regenerating.

Suggestions, improvements, comments and questions are welcome.
